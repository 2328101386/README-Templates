# Project Tittle

## Proposal:  
###  Abstract :  
    1, OpenDwarf problems  
    2, OpenMP + OpenACC  

###  Introduction:  
    1, 13 Dwarfs  
    2, OpenMP + OpenACC  

###  Why Important:  
    1, Why
    2, Why
    
###  Specific Benchmarks  
    1, Gem:  
    2, BFS  
    
###  Hypothesis:  
    1, OpenMP or OpenACC which one is faster(Are the benchmarks suitable for CPU or GPU)  
    2, same for both benchmarks?  
    
###  Implementation and Optimization:  
    1,Servers architecture  
    
# To do list:  
   1, Run both under OpenCL --> original implementation  
   1, Proposal
