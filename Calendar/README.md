#### Week 3 : Oct 07 -- Oct 14
1. After discussed with Dr. Balci, we decided to use each javascript file to store
one level. The reasons are as follows:
```
a. It is inconvenient to frequently interact with the server within the game.
b. Using front-end to process the game can reduce the workload of the server.
c. It can be efficient and fast to process the game in front end.
d. After finishing one level, send all the data to the backend.
```
